# Clipboard Cleanse
*Automatically remove tracking information from copied URLs*

- [WIP] Supports MacOS, Windows
  - Linux support will come later if I have enough motivation
- [WIP] Supports removing tracking information from links from YouTube, Spotify, Google, and more!
- Unfortunately on MacOS, we have to poll the clipboard. This polling interval defaults to 500ms but is configurable.
